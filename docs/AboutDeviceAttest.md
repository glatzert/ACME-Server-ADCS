# Device-Attest-01

Device Attestation is a challenge type defined in the [ACME Device Attestation draft](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-acme-device-attest-03.html).
It is used to issue certificates for devices that support Apple's DeviceCheck or Android's SafetyNet attestation services or TPM based attestation.

It is currently in draft state and not yet standardized, but it is supported (at least) by Apple devices and can be used to issue certificates for these devices within ACME-ADCS.
To use this you'll need some MDM solution, like Microsoft Intune, to manage the devices and to provide the attestation service.

To enable device-attest-01 and permanent-identifiers, you need to create a profile configuration in the `appsettings.Production.json`

```jsonc
{
  // Other configuration settings...

  // [Required] Issuance profile configuration - there's no default profile, you must define at least one.
  "Profiles": {

    // The profile name is used to identify the profile in the ACME-Server.
    // You may choose any arbitrary name, that contains only alphanumeric characters, dashes and underscores.
    "device-profile1": {

      // [Required] List of supported identifiers for this profile.
      // Possible valies are: dns, ip, permanent-identifier, hardware-module
      "SupportedIdentifiers": [ "permanent-identifier" ],

      // [Optional] If true, external account binding is required to use this profile. The default is false.
      "RequireExternalAccountBinding": false,

      // [Optional] The following settings are used to validate the identifiers.
      "IdentifierValidation": {

        // [Optional] Configure permanent-identifier validation
        "PermanentIdentifier": {

          // [Optional] ValidationRegex is used to restrict the permanent identifiers.
          // The default is .* - so no restriction.
          "ValidationRegex": ".*"
        }
      },

      // [Optional] The following settings are used configure challenge validation
      "ChallengeValidation": {

        // [Optional] Configuration for device-attest-01 challenges.
        "DeviceAttest01": {

          // [Optional] Enables remote validation of device-attest-01 challenges (see below)
          "RemoteValidationUrl": "https://device-attest-validation.example.com",

          // [Optional] Configuration for apple type device-attest-01 challenges.
          "Apple": {

            // [Optional] The root certificate for apple device-attest-01 challenges.
            // The default is the apple enterprise root attestation certificate from https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/private/
            "RootCertificates": [
              "MIICJDCC...gN/r"
            ]
          }
        }
      },

      // [Required] The following settings are used to issue the certificate.
      "ADCSOptions": {
        // [Required] The CA-Server to use for certificate issuance.
        "CAServer": "CA.FQDN.com\\CA Name",

        // [Required] The template to use for certificate issuance.
        "TemplateName": "ACME-Device-Template"
      }
    },
```

Since the ACME-ADCS server cannot fully verify the attestation besides it being properly signed and 'fresh', ACME-ADCS optionally allows to contact a remote API to verify the attestation.
It will be a post request to the URL configured in the `RemoteValidationUrl` setting of the `DeviceAttest01` challenge validation configuration, that contains the following json-serialized data:
